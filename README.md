# Chime:The Original NeoBank


**Overview and Origin**

Back in 2012, Chris Britt, the senior product leader for Visa, and Ryan King, the Vice President of Engineering at Plaxo, decided to join forces and design a bank that was completely digital. With Britt’s background in the finance world and King’s background in social networking, the two were able to develop Chime. Chime first went public on Dr. Phil in April 2014, at this time Neo Banking was still a new thing, and many people thought the idea was crazy. But eventually, the duo were able to get money from investors such as Sequoia Capital Globe Equities, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, General Atlantic, Tiger Global, Dragoneer, and more. As of today they have received over $1.7 billion in funding and is now the biggest Neo Bank globally.

**Business Activities**

The mission behind Chime was to make the banking experience easier for the average person. Before Chime, even less than 5 years ago, 4.5% of households were unbanked and 16% of Americans were underbanked, being where your bank account value keeps going under due to overdraft, monthly fees, and excessive loans. Chime’s partnership with the Bancorp Bank and Stride Bank allowed them to give people savings and checking accounts without overdraft fees, monthly service fees, minimum balance requirements, and more. They even use Google Analytics to track customer app use and reactions to certain features in the app, and are able to update the app with programming technologies such as HTML5 and jQuery. As of January 2023, Chime recorded over 21 million customers. 

**Landscapes**

Most people would consider Chime as Online Banking, but really it’s called Neo Banking or Challenger Banker because there is no physical location for Chime, rather it’s an app that partners with banks to provide financial services to users. Since Chime isn’t a physical establishment, Chime is able to provide services to customers that most traditional banks can’t, such as no-fee savings and checking accounts, Chime-branded Visa debit card, the ability to directly deposit a paycheck two days earlys, and fee-free overdraft of up to $200. Competitor companies such as Majority, Card.com, Community Advantage, and Community Choice Financial have tried the same Neo Bank approach that Chime have done thoroughly, but Chime still reigns supreme in that market.

**Results**

As a result of Chime’s uprising, more people have switched from establishment banking to digital banking. 10 years ago less than 1 out of 20 people had a digital bank account, but at the end of 2021 over 15 million adults had switched to a digital bank. Many factors contribute to what makes a valuable Neo Bank, such as number of customers, income, cost and profit per customer, and conversion rates to paying products. Chime succeeds in all of the these considering that they have over 21 million customers, have gained over $1.7 billion in investment, have profited their customers by not overcharging them, and their products, such as the Chime debit card, make purchasing items more smooth. Despite the competition, Chime is definitely the most successful neo bank as of today.

**Recommendations**

If I were running the company, I would consider partnering with more banks since Chime is only partnered with two. That way, customers would have access to a wider range of financial services, they’d also have more choices with how they want to set up their bank account. To apply this I would use Machine Learning to help the automated processes at banks move faster, and Artificial Intelligence for better tracking of fraud and to be able to make more accurate predictions.
